# Erato
A truly minimalistic stylesheet. Erato is intended to be used for simple sites like an about page or a blog.
Erato is inspired by [these](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) [great](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) [websites](http://evenbettermotherfucking.website/). You can view Erato in use [at my website](https://nokaa.moe).

As small as it is (43 lines of Sass), you can easily modify it to suit your needs. I have tried to create variables for the things that are most likely to be modified.

I am not a designer, so if you think that something can be improved, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please keep in mind that Erato's goal is minimalism, so additions that don't seem useful to me will probably be rejected. The great part about Free Software is that you can create your own version and distribute it to others.
