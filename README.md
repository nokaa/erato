# Erato
A truly minimalistic stylesheet. Erato is intended to be used for simple sites like an about page or a blog. Erato weighs in at _813 bytes_ minified.
Erato is inspired by [these](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) [great](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) [websites](http://evenbettermotherfucking.website/). You can view Erato in use [at my website](https://nokaa.moe).

### Goals
My goals in building Erato were to create a very small stylesheet that looked good and worked properly on all screen sizes. I wanted to accomplish this without the use of Javascript, because it's a pain in the ass.
So far, Erato seems to have accomplished these goals, so hopefully all future changes will be minor.

### Using
Erato provides several convenience classes. They have some documentation in [erato.sass](https://github.com/nokaa/erato/blob/master/erato.sass)

As small as it is (103 lines of Sass), you can easily modify it to suit your needs. I have tried to create variables for the things that are most likely to be modified.

I am not a designer, so if you think that something can be improved, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Please keep in mind that Erato's goal is minimalism, so additions that don't seem useful to me will probably be rejected. The great part about Free Software is that you can create your own version and distribute it to others.
